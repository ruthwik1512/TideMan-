The system works by using voter rankings to calculate preferences between candidates. 
It then forms pairs of candidates where one is preferred over the other, sorts these 
pairs by the strength of the preference, and locks them into a directed graph while avoiding 
cycles. The winner is the candidate who is not locked in over by any other candidate.
